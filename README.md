# Computer-Vision-nanodegree-projects
In this repository all the three projects completed in computer vision nano degree are available.Projects are Facial keypoint detection, Image captioning, Landmark Detection &amp; Robot Tracking (SLAM).
## Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection
[Facial Keypoint Detection Project](https://github.com/AnshuTrivedi/Computer-Vision-nanodegree-projects/tree/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints)</br>
In this project, I combined knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a 
facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!
some results from face detection :



## Project 2: Image Captioning
[Image Captioning Project](https://github.com/AnshuTrivedi/Computer-Vision-nanodegree-projects/tree/master/P2_Image_Captioning) </br>
In this project, I created a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.
After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train network, tested network on novel images!

## Project 3: Landmark Detection
[Landmark detection Project](https://github.com/AnshuTrivedi/Computer-Vision-nanodegree-projects/tree/master/P3_SLAM) </br>
In this project, I implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! ,combined what i
 know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered 
by a robot, over time. SLAM gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of 
landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. 
This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
